# 🚪 Digital-Wardrobe 👕

## 📝 Overview
Digital Wardrobe is an innovative web application designed to revolutionize how we plan and manage our outfits. Our vision is to simplify the daily task of deciding what to wear by providing an organized, visual representation of clothing pieces and complete outfits, while also keeping track of their usage for different occasions. 

In the future, we aim to transform Digital Wardrobe into a Progressive Web App (PWA) and/or mobile application, empowering users with accessibility and seamless experience across platforms. Furthermore, we envision integrating AI-powered outfit suggestions tailored to occasions, locations, and local dress codes, starting with our home country, Cyprus.
